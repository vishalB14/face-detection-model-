# 👁️ Face Detection using OpenCV

A real-time Face Detection system built using **Python** and **OpenCV**.  
This project uses the **Haar Cascade Classifier** to detect human faces from webcam input.

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 Real-time webcam face detection  
- 🧠 Haar Cascade frontal face classifier  
- 🖼️ Automatic bounding box around detected faces  
- ⚡ Lightweight and fast implementation  
- 🧪 Implemented in Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Haar Cascade XML Model
- Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vishalB14/face-detection-model-.git
cd face-detection-model-
```

### 2️⃣ Install Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Project

Open the notebook:

```
face_detection_using_opencv.ipynb
```

Run all cells to start face detection.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Accesses webcam input
2. Converts image to grayscale
3. Loads Haar Cascade classifier
4. Detects faces in frame
5. Draws bounding box around detected faces

---

## 📸 Sample Output

The system detects faces and highlights them using a rectangular bounding box in real-time.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add Deep Learning based face detection (DNN)
- Add Face Recognition feature
- Deploy as a Flask web application
- Improve detection accuracy in low-light conditions
